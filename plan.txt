I want to create a telegram bot, which will serve as a personal assistant. 
It will use AI to parse user messages and write responses. It will recognise when user wants either to be reminded of something, make a task for themselves, or find out what he planned for himself for any particular day.
We should use Anthropic's Claude 3.5 with tool use to parse user intents and route to appropriate actions.

The app will use the Linear API to keep track of both tasks and reminders:
- Tasks will be stored as Linear issues
- Reminders will also be Linear issues with:
  - "reminder" label to distinguish them
  - Due date for when to remind
  - Status to track if reminder was sent/acknowledged

Architecture:
1. Telegram Bot Frontend
   - Handles user interactions
   - Formats responses
   - Manages conversation flow

2. Claude 3.5 Integration
   - Parses natural language input using tool use capability
   - Determines user intent (task/reminder/query)
   - Extracts relevant details (dates, times, descriptions)
   - Formats responses in natural language

3. Linear Integration
   - Stores all tasks and reminders
   - Uses webhooks to notify bot of upcoming reminders
   - Organizes items with labels and statuses
   - Separate team/project for personal items

4. Core Features:
   - Create tasks with due dates
   - Set reminders with specific times
   - Query upcoming tasks/reminders
   - Mark items as complete
   - List items for specific dates

Future Considerations:
- May need database if Linear limitations are hit
- Time zone handling for reminders
- User authentication/authorization
- Rate limit handling
- Error logging and monitoring
