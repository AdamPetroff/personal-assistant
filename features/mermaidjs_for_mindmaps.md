# MermaidJS for Mindmaps

I want to be able to create mindmaps based on communication with the bot. Mermaid.js can be used for this. Based on some topic, the bot would help me generate a mindmap definition in extended markdown, save it to a trello card, and then render it and send the mindmap to the user via a telegram message.
