# Responding to Messages

## Description

I want to be able to respond to messages from the bot. The bot should be able to respond back to my replies, keeping the conversation going in replies. For example, if bot sends me a Daily leading message, I should be able to ask questions about it, and the bot would then answer my questions.
The conversation should continue only in replies, not in the main message. Sending a non reply message will let the bot resume its normal behavior.
