# Groceries Rating

Upload photo of grocery store receipt, ai looks up the ingredients in the food items, and makes an overview about how healthy your purchase is. There should be a chart containing info about the healhy ones, unhealthy ones, how much additives, how much chemicals, how much fat, carbs, protein. Make this into a mobile app and make money.

## Questions

- is there an api for getting info about food items?
    - if not, we have to somehow get at least an image of the ingredients label of the item, and then use an ai to extract the info from the image.
